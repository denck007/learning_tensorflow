# learning_tensorflow
Playing around with toy data to understand how tensorflow works

Code was written using Jupyter and Tensorflow 1.1.0-rc0 using the official docker image

This project is simply a collection of things I am working through to get a feel for how to work with Tensorflow. 

## Linear regression:
* Simple linear regression, nothing fancy. 

## Polynomial regression:
* Set up so that all controls are at the top. 
* Implemented regularization
* Generic method of dealing with powers, so additional powers only requrire the change of 1 numbner
